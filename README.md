INTRODUCTION:

Hello web visitor! 

Welcome to where my code lives in the cloud.

This is my story..

Before I taught myself Python in 2021, I was still technically capable and good with technology in general, hepling friends and family with IT problems.

Nintendo DS Zero-day exploit:

I exploited my first zero-day when I was 16 years old, I had pokemon on Nintendo DS, and you could not modify and cheat on games natively, I researched methods of how to hack the games and found some answes in forums and stackoverflow, I found a way to jailbreak specific devices so loge as the serial number matched a certain pattern. By manually connecting two pins in the usb plug on the device, this triggered a factory reboot, before which I created a partitioned jailbroken OS called Hakaute. Giving the ability to "Push" the saved game data from the DS to the partition.. the I edited/modified the game data and then pulled it back.

I continued to exploit the same zero-day vulnerablitly over 8 years of different generation devies such as the 2DS, 3DS & Switch.

Automated Hourly Check Call:

I was working for a company which implemented new proceedures which included hourly check calls where i had to call the automated line and dial my site pin "1234" and my personal pin "4321" and do this over 5 days, whch lead to an annyoying repetative task. 

I used a no code app to automate this task, saving me 60 mins a week, or 52 hours a year, and sticking it to big brother, also granted me a taste of the power of automation.

Python:

The start of my programing journey was reading a book called "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python" which I really enjoyed and continued to seek other resources including YouTube, W3Schools, Geeks4Geeks, FreeCodecamp, CodeChef, CodeAbbey, HackerRank, 

Cyber:

My Python coding and interest expanded into cyber when I started finsing hack the box websites and In Oct 2024 I graduated from the University of Greenwich with a 2:1 BSc in Computer Science majoring in Cyber Security accredited by the GCHQ. I am currently improving my professional presence, on GitHub, LinkedIn, a custom e-portfolio. To demonstrate experience and skills in both Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence.
